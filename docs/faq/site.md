# About This Website
The Seattle Community Network Docs website is the central hub for information about our community and networks. Here, we describe our infrastructure, how to set-up hardware and software, how you can start your own community network, our community rules, and more.

This website is maintained by our volunteers, much like the rest of our services. This means you can help us improve it by adding missing information, clarifying confusing points, or even just fixing typos you notice while you’re reading. See [Contribute to SCN Docs](../contribute/contribute.md) to learn more about how you can contribute to this website.

If you are looking for our main website, it is located at [www.seattlecommunitynetwork.org](https://www.seattlecommunitynetwork.org).
