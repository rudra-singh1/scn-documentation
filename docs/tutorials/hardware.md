### CBRS-Compatible Unlocked Smartphone

We purchase refurbished Google Pixel 4 smartphones because they are affordable, provide all
necessary smartphone features, and are CBRS-compatible.

Note that purchasing CBRS-compatible phones can be a logistical challenge. We've experienced trouble purchasing
from vendors that send incorrect models of phones that don't support CBRS band and we had to go back and forth.
Test your phones before distributing them!

Here is [one spot](https://www.backmarket.com/search?q=pixel%204&ga_search=pixel%204) to purchase refurbished phones.
