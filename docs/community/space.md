# Seattle Community Network Lab Space
## This page under construction!
We now have a newly opening community network lab and hack space, co-located with the gracious and welcoming [/dev/hack](https://devhack.net) hackerspace in Seattle, WA, with whom we share full mutual membership.

Address: 4534 1/2 University Way NE, Seattle WA 98105

SCN Lab Space Membership is for keyholder access to the space only, and is absolutely not required to volunteer with us. Members can bring in guests at any time. 

Here are the current member [application](https://www.cognitoforms.com/TheSilentTaskForce1/SCNSpaceMembershipApplicationFormAndAgreement) and working draft of [policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jHKDoY01IUAhroEsmL_nff-2he1DZx-30uwkQw4jY6A/edit).
