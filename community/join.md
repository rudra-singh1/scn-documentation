# Join Us
Seattle Community Network has a place for **everyone**. Whether you'd like to join
to get free Internet, get involved to help out your community, learn some skills
so that you can get a job, or all of the above!

**PRO TIP**{: .label .label-green} Do everything on this page! Our community is spread out in a lot of different places, so doing everything is the best way to make sure you don't miss out.

## Join our Discord!
Discord is a messaging platform that we use to stay in touch
with each other, organize our different teams, and update everyone on last minute things.

This is a MUST do if you don't want to get left out!

### Follow these steps to join our Discord server:

1. Click the [invite link](https://discord.gg/sZkK5RpeCE) to enter the Discord server.
2. Introduce yourself on the `#introductions` channel and friend request one of the moderators so they can chat with you (you can write `@moderators` in your message to get their attention). They will need to add a role for you as a "member" so you can stay on the server before you log out, otherwise you will have to be invited and join again.
3. Install Discord on your [computer](https://discord.com/download), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord&hl=en_US&gl=US), or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-talk-hangout/id985746746) device to always stay up-to-date.

## Chat with someone!
The best way to get involved with the network is to find someone that can direct you!
